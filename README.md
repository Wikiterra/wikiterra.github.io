## Web template

Wikiterra is a web constructed using the web template [Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/digitalgarden) created and maintained by Ole Eskild Steensen.

The Digital Garden template is use 11Ty a Static Site Generator (SSG), this permit to write content in an easy markup language like markdown format and convert it to a web standard format (HTML, CSS, JS).

The benefits from using markdown is that the syntax is more simple and you only need to write the content of the articles, the rest is generated by the SSG.

The template was designed to be used as a [Obsidian Digital Garden plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden), a plugin of the Obsidian app a knowledge base and markdown editor that permit to publish vault as a free alternative of the paid [Obsidian publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) method. However can be edited with any text/code editor because markdown is plain text.

To create and visualize the content as a wesbite you need Node.js a runtime environment that render and deploy the website using the 11Ty template, for that you need to use the Node.js package manager aka `npm` and run these commands on the computer terminal.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run watch:eleventy
```

With these commands you can create a static website however you can do the same and host on a online we server, like GitHub, CLoudfare, Netlify, Vercel. You can find more info about [hosting alternatives in the offical documentation](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/hosting-alternatives/)

For GitHub you can automate the process using [GitHub actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) specifying the options in the config file [.github/workflows/build.yml]](.github/workflows/build.yml). Here`s a [GitHub workflow example](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden/discussions/389#discussioncomment-7437123) for the Digital Garden template.

And here is the detailed process, it is a similar that doing locally but GitHub do extra steps, generates an Ubuntu virtual machine, copy the content and execute the npm commands.
