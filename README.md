Wikiterra is a web constructed using the web template
[Digital Garden template](https://github.com/oleeskild/digitalgarden) created and maintained by Ole Eskild Steensen.

The web template is designed to be used with 11Ty as a Static Site Generator (SSG). This permit to write content in an easy markup language like markdown format and convert it to a web format (HTML, CSS, JS).

The benefits from using markdown is that the syntax is more simple and you only need to write the content, the rest is generated by the SSG.

It was designed to be used with Obsidian.md a knowledge base and markdown editor app, but you can use any editor and visualize with nodeJS server.
